## My Leadership Philosophy

I believe that the most important facets of any team are its approach to
communication and its drive for improvement. Free, open, and constructive
communication are the keys that allow a diverse set of individuals to
positively impact how we operate and solve problems. I also love organizations
where individuals are empowered to make decisions and solve problems. Ideally,
everyone tries to be [relentlessly resourceful](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html).
