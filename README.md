# My Leadership README

## My Leadership Philosophy

I believe that the most important facets of any team are its approach to
communication and its drive for improvement. Free, open, and constructive
communication are the keys that allow a diverse set of individuals to
positively impact how we operate and solve problems. I also love organizations
where individuals are empowered to make decisions and solve problems. Ideally,
everyone tries to be [relentlessly resourceful](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html).

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

What makes you grumpy?

- When people or teams avoid problems because they're hard or because they 
  don't know the answer.
- Disagreements that turn personal (but not necessarily emotional) or when 
  conversations cease being constructive
- Hypocracy

How will I know when you're grumpy?

- I'll do my best to tell you, and if it's a situation where I don't feel 
  comfortable bringing forward my discomfort I'll find you later to chat 1:1.
- I have a not-great tendency to also get pretty quiet and pensive during
  a large conversation when I'm annoyed.

How can I help you when you're grumpy?

- Encourage me to speak if you feel like I'm holding back. Talking through
  issues will generally make me feel better.

How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

- Any type is good, but I prefer channels where it's easy to go back and forth
  in a discussion (i.e. in person and slack over email)

How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

- As it happens

How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

- Either one is good

What makes 1:1s the most valuable to you?

- Thought partnership - I want to be able to discuss my challenges and hear
  your thoughts on what I've been doing.

What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

What do you need from your manager?

- Quick feedback, willingness to be a sounding board for issues, and the
  autonomy to be creative.

From your team?

From your peers? (outside the team)

What's your favorite baked good?

- Carrot cake
